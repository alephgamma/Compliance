# Compliance

Compliance in an IT security context means several things. In a broad sense, security covers the physical, administrative and technical requirements, legal and contractual, with the implementation of security best practices and standards on any program or project with it's respective IT systems. RedHat's OpenShift Compliance Operator can be used to manage administrative (manual checks) and implement certain security settings.

This repo contains useful Compliance Operator information, tools and techniques. 

This is a work in progress.

# `TL;DR` Squishy terms
* **Compliance:** Legal and/or contractual requirements to secure or present -in regards to non technical settings- how a program or project has implemented security best practices and standards.
* **Operator:** An Operator is a Kubernetes plug-in component or application that manages and controls the state of Kubernetes resources.
* **Upstream:** This term is best understood (to me) as the development version of a product. In a small example, Fedora is the upstream source for RHEL. The hard part is connecting **ALL** the upstream projects with the downstream product names. 
* **Physical:** The fences, walls, doors, locks and badges required to touch a system
* **Administrative:** The paperwork, manual procedures, HR policies and other written instructions - AKA the bureaucracy. 
* **Technical:**
    * Implementers
    * Researchers
* **Policy**
